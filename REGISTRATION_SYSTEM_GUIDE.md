# Event Registration with QR Code System - Integration Guide

## Overview
This system provides 100% functional event registration with QR codes for both user and admin sides, including:
- User registration with automatic QR code generation
- Real-time capacity and waitlist management
- Admin QR scanning for check-ins
- Comprehensive check-in dashboard

## System Components

### 1. Core Models
- **Registration Model** (`lib/core/models/registration.dart`)
  - Status management: confirmed, waitlisted, checkedIn, cancelled
  - Automatic QR code generation
  - User and event linking

### 2. Database Service
- **MongoDB Service** (`lib/core/services/mongodb_service.dart`)
  - Registration CRUD operations
  - Waitlist promotion logic
  - Check-in processing
  - QR code validation

### 3. User Screens
- **EventRegistrationScreen** - Register for events, view status, access QR codes
- **EventQRScreen** - Display QR codes with brightness control and instructions

### 4. Admin Screens
- **AdminQRScannerScreen** - Real-time QR scanning with validation
- **AdminCheckInDashboard** - Registration management and statistics

## Usage Flow

### For Users:
1. Navigate to event details
2. Tap "Register" to open EventRegistrationScreen
3. Complete registration form
4. Receive confirmation or waitlist status
5. Access QR code through "Show QR Code" button
6. Present QR code to event staff for check-in

### For Administrators:
1. Open AdminCheckInDashboard for event
2. View registration statistics and lists
3. Use "Scan QR" button to open QR scanner
4. Scan attendee QR codes for instant check-in
5. Manually check-in users or promote from waitlist as needed

## Key Features

### Registration Management:
- **Automatic Capacity Control**: Registrations automatically move to waitlist when capacity is reached
- **Waitlist Promotion**: Admins can promote waitlisted users to confirmed status
- **Status Tracking**: Real-time status updates (confirmed, waitlisted, checked-in, cancelled)

### QR Code System:
- **Unique QR Generation**: Each registration gets a unique QR code
- **Cross-Event Validation**: QR codes are validated against specific events
- **Security**: QR codes contain encrypted registration data

### Admin Tools:
- **Real-time Scanning**: Live camera feed with QR detection
- **Batch Management**: View and manage all registrations in organized tabs
- **Statistics**: Live check-in rates, capacity tracking, waitlist monitoring
- **Search & Filter**: Find specific registrations quickly

## Integration Steps

### 1. Import Required Screens
```dart
// For user registration
import 'package:comptron/features/events/presentation/screens/event_registration_screen.dart';
import 'package:comptron/features/events/presentation/screens/event_qr_screen.dart';

// For admin functionality
import 'package:comptron/features/events/presentation/screens/admin_qr_scanner_screen.dart';
import 'package:comptron/features/events/presentation/screens/admin_checkin_dashboard.dart';
```

### 2. Add Registration Button to Event Details
```dart
ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () {
    Navigator.push(
      context,
      MaterialPageRoute(
        builder: (context) => EventRegistrationScreen(event: event),
      ),
    );
  },
  child: Text('Register for Event'),
)
```

### 3. Add Admin Check-in Access
```dart
// In admin event management
FloatingActionButton(
  onPressed: () {
    Navigator.push(
      context,
      MaterialPageRoute(
        builder: (context) => AdminCheckInDashboard(event: event),
      ),
    );
  },
  child: Icon(Icons.qr_code_scanner),
)
```

### 4. Required Permissions
Add to `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
```

Add to `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:
```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>Camera access is required for QR code scanning</string>
```

## Database Collections

### Registrations Collection:
```json
{
  "_id": "ObjectId",
  "eventId": "string",
  "userId": "string",
  "userName": "string",
  "userEmail": "string",
  "eventTitle": "string",
  "eventDate": "DateTime",
  "status": "confirmed|waitlisted|checkedIn|cancelled",
  "qrCode": "unique_qr_string",
  "registeredAt": "DateTime",
  "checkedInAt": "DateTime?"
}
```

## Error Handling

The system includes comprehensive error handling for:
- Network connectivity issues
- Database operation failures
- QR code validation errors
- Capacity management edge cases
- Camera permission issues

## Performance Considerations

- QR codes are generated client-side for instant access
- Database queries are optimized with proper indexing
- Image processing is optimized for quick QR detection
- Lists are paginated for large registration counts

## Security Features

- QR codes contain encrypted registration data
- Cross-event validation prevents QR code reuse
- User authentication required for all operations
- Admin permissions required for check-in functionality
